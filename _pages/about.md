I am a second-year PhD student in Computer Science at Vanderbilt University, advised by Dr. Jie Ying Wu at [MAPLE Labs](https://vu-maple-lab.github.io), where we develop algorithms to advance systems, environments, and their interactions in the realm of robot-assisted surgeries. My research interests are at the intersection of 3D vision, graphics, and robotics to enhance and develop computer-assisted interventions in minimally invasive surgeries. My current research explores ways to create realistic surgical simulations via 3D style transfer and to automate robotic surgical tasks via end-to-end learning. My hobbies include playing musical instruments, golfing, and traveling. 

For collaboration, party invites, or any inquiries, please contact me at john.j.han@vanderbilt.edu. I would love to get to know you and your work.
