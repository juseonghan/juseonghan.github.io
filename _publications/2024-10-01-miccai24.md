excerpt: 'Style transfer is a promising approach to close the sim-to-real gap in medical endoscopy. Rendering realistic endoscopic videos by traversing pre-operative scans (such as MRI or CT) can generate realistic simulations as well as ground truth camera poses and depth maps. Although image-to-image (I2I) translation models such as CycleGAN perform well, they are unsuitable for video-to-video synthesis due to the lack of temporal consistency, resulting in artifacts between frames. We propose MeshBrush, a neural mesh stylization method to synthesize temporally consistent videos with differentiable rendering. MeshBrush uses the underlying geometry of patient imaging data while leveraging existing I2I methods. With learned per-vertex textures, the stylized mesh guarantees consistency while producing high-fidelity outputs. We demonstrate that mesh stylization is a promising approach for creating realistic simulations for downstream tasks such as training and preoperative planning.'
